# Cloud Utilities for Deep Learning ⛅️

A super lightweight cloud management tool designed with deep learning applications in mind.

This project is still a work in progress. We welcome all contributions, suggestions, and use-cases. Reach out to us over GitHub or at team@for.ai with ideas!

## Quickstart

### Install:

```
git clone git@github.com:for-ai/cloud.git
sudo pip install -e cloud
```

### Config:

See `configs/cloud.toml-*` for instructions on how to authenticate for each provider (Google Cloud, AWS EC2, and Azure).

Place your completed configuration file (named `cloud.toml`) in either root `/` or `$HOME`. Otherwise, provide a full path to the file in `$CLOUD_CFG`.

### Usage:
#### GPU
```python
import cloud
cloud.connect()

# gpu instances have a dedicated GPU so we don't need to worry
# about preemption or acquiring/releasing accelerators online.

while True:
  # train your model or w/e

cloud.down()  # stop the instance (does not delete instance)
```

#### TPU (Only on GCP)
```python
import cloud
cloud.connect()

tpu = cloud.instance.tpu.up(preemptible=True)  # acquire the accelerator
while True:
  if not tpu.usable:
    tpu.delete(async=True)  # release the accelerator in the background
    tpu = cloud.instance.tpu.up(preemptible=True)  # acquire a new accelerator
  else:
    # train your model or w/e
    
cloud.down()  # release all resources, then stop the instance (does not delete instance)
```

### cloud.connect(arg=None)
Takes/Creates a `cloud.Instance` object and sets `cloud.instance` to it. 

| param | desc. |
| :------- | :------- |
| arg | One of: |
|     | - None (default), will infer from `config.toml` |
|     | - cloud.Instance object. |
| **returns** | **desc.** |
| cloud_env | a cloud.Instance.  |

### cloud.down()
Calls `cloud.instance.down()`.

### cloud.delete(confirm=True)
Calls `cloud.instance.delete(confirm)`.

### cloud.Resource

| `usable ` | bool, whether this resource is usable |
| **methods** | **desc.** |
| `down()` | stop the resource. Note: this should not necessarily delete this resource |
| `delete()` | delete this resource |

### cloud.Instance(Resource)

## Amazon EC2
### cloud.AWSInstance(Instance)

A `cloud.Instance` object for AWS EC2 instances.

## Azure
### cloud.AzureInstance(Instance)

A `cloud.Instance` object for Microsoft Azure instances.

## Google Cloud

Our GCPInstance requires that your instances have `gcloud` installed and properly authenticated so that `gcloud alpha compute tpus create test_name` runs without issue.

### cloud.GCPInstance(Instance)
